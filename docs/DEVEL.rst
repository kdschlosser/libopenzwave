How to develop for libopenzwave
===================================


For those of you that know how to write python code do you best to keep with
PEP8. 4 space indents please.

This is the largest requirement (other then the code working) for a PR is
documentation. If any changes are made that require updates to the
documentation or documentation to be added, then do it. There is no middle
ground here.

Do you know what just about every developer hates more then writing
documentation? Using a program that has no documentation!!!!.
IT MUST BE DONE!!!. If you do not know how to. Then tell us that.. We will not
do it for you but we will be more then happy to educate you on how to.


For those of you that are "greenhorns" or are looking to get involved in a
leading edge Home Automation control system but do not know where to start...

Open an issue on our GitHub page telling us that you want to be involved,
Tell us about your background (or lack of). Toss some questions at us for
things you want to know about. There are quite a few years of knowledge the
developers have. We will be able to provide you all kinds of reading material
and information. We were all once at the same spot you are at. There is no
"god complex" developers here. Me personally I love to teach and help. If you
do not understand what is being said then say so I have no problems with
explaining the same thing multiple times in different ways. In order for you to
move forward you need to fully understand the information being given.


I have a life statement that I do encourage everyone to live by.
I only know how to do one thing. READ. With that I can do anything I want,
the words "I don't know how." and "I can't." really mean "I am to lazy to do it."

The biggest thing is do not get discouraged!!! You have the only tool you need
to be able to do anything you want, You know how to READ!..
